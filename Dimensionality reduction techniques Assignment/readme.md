# Dimensionality reduction techniques
Through this assignment, I understood various methods like PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE, UMAP, and t-SNE, and their application to real-world datasets.
In this assignment,  we were asked to create notebooks to perform dimensionality reduction techniques for various data sets.

## Tasks
**Write a colab for dimensionality reduction techniques for various data sets**

The colab should cover cases where it works and where it does not works. The colab should include -
  
a) PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE
  
b) UMAP and t-sne

Do proper visualization as well as techniques showcasing selecting the hyperparameter

Use UMAP visualizer and provide screenshots

 
**Write a colab to illustrate how dimensionality reduction technique like umap can be used followed by clustering. (see slide show in clustering) as well as a classification feature extraction technique**
 

**Demonstrate dimensionality reduction using data bricks**

## Deliverables - 

- part 1
  - DimensionalityReduction.ipynb (colab file)
  - zoo.csv (dataset)
- part 2
  - UMAP_Clustering(DimensionalityReduction).ipynb
  - StudentsPerformance.csv
    
For part 3 - (databricks)
