In this part of the assignment, The main objective is to demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning project using no code. For that I used JADBio, a robust AutoML platform which aims to make machine learning accessible to all regardless of expertise or programming skills.

JADBio is very straightforward to use:
* Upload your data
* Transform your data (optional)
* Analyze your data
* View your results (optional)
* Share your results
* Test your data (optional)

To access JADBio, in your browser of choice, navigate to JADBIO.com. If you don't have any account you can signup for their 14 Days Trial account.
### Creating the project
On the MENU sidebar at the left of the JADBio window, click on Projects. This will bring you to the Projects window, which includes the Create a new Project function. Click on the CREATE button. Name your Project adding a Description. Click on the CREATE button. Your new project will now appear in the Projects window.
### UPLOADING A DATASET
Under ACTIONS, in the top left corner, click Add Data to add a dataset to this project. Datasets includes a description of all of the datasets in a tabular format:
* Name
* Created
* Features
* Samples
* Size<br>
Under the Actions column, JADBio provides buttons to:
    * Preview Dataset
    * Perform Analysis
    * Detach Dataset

### ANALYSES
Click on the Analyses label, to view the previously run analyses in the JADBio Use Cases project. Within the Analyses page, JADBio describes all analyses, including those currently running.  Furthermore, the analysis type is described by an icon. Here, we have Regression, Classification, and Survival (Time to Event) analyses.
Analyses also includes a description in tabular format:

* Name
* Started (date)
* Dataset
* Metric
* Metric Value
* Outcome
* Type
* Progress
* Actions, includes:<br>
  * View results
  * Apply model and
  * Remove results buttons

### APPLIED MODELS
 Click on the Applied Models label, to view the results from the reapplication of a model on a novel or test dataset.
Applied Models description includes:
* Dataset
* Analysis used
* Progress
* Actions, includes:<br>
  *  View Results
  * Remove Applied Model

These are some common tasks performed in the JADBio tool to demonstrate the machine learning project. The analysis report, analysis prediction, validation prediction, all can be found in this repository. Here is the medium article link - https://medium.com/@agarwal.sajal30/exploring-the-potential-of-automl-through-jadbio-a-personal-hands-on-journey-f8dccb4d5df9 which is published by me, describing all the steps taken and their outcomes.

The dataset used is "Creditability - German Credit Data" which can be found at - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mpwolke/cusersmarildownloadsgermancsv
