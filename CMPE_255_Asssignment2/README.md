CMPE 255: Data Mining<br>
Assignment 1<br>

This is the second assignment which is focused on teaching us the basics of pycaret and automl. Through this assignment I learned about the Jadbio tool which automates the machine learning process, and the second part of this assignment focused on the pycaret, an open-source low code machine learning library.

Part 1 of this assignment was to perform multiple data science operations on a dataset using the chatgpt code interpreter. For this I used the "World Happiness Report up to 2022" kaggle dataset and performed various data science operations using chatgpt.

Part 2 of this assignment was to create an application using gpt-engineer and with the help of Visual studio code extension github copilot chat perform multiple operations such as writing a function, testcase, and refactor it. But due to no access to the extension (github copilot chat) I have used used gpt-engineer to create the entire application and another visual studio code extension github coplit to create and refactor the test cases.
