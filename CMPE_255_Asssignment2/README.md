CMPE 255: Data Mining
Assignment 2

This is the second assignment which is focused on teaching us the basics of pycaret and automl. Through this assignment I learned about the Jadbio tool which automates the machine learning process, and the second part of this assignment focused on the pycaret, an open-source low code machine learning library. Both the parts of the assignment can be found under the respectives directories (Assignment1_AutoML and Assignment2_Pycaret)

### Part 1: JADBio AutoML
In this part of the assignment, I used JADBio to demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning (no code) project. JADBio stands for Just Add Data and aims to make machine learning accessible to all regardless of expertise or programming skills. It makes it easy and affordable for data scientists and life-science professional to use data science to discover knowledge, while reducing time and effort by combining an end-to-end machine learning platform for data analysts

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is "Creditability - German Credit Data". It can be found at - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mpwolke/cusersmarildownloadsgermancsv

### Part 2: PyCaret and Gradio
In this part of the assignment, I used PyCaret and Gradio to perform low code data mining tasks.
Tasks peformed - 
* Binary Classification
* Multiclass Classification 
* Regression 
* Clustering 
* Anomaly Detection 
* Time Series Forecasting Univariate without Exogenous Variables
* Time Series Forecasting Univariate with Exogenous Variables

### Dataset
Multiple datasets has been used in this part. The datasets used are from the kaggle and some are generated by the chatgpt
