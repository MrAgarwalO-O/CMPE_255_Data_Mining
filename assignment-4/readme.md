# Apache Beam data engineering assignment

This repository contains three separate tasks demonstrating various data analysis and visualization techniques. Each project focuses on a specific dataset and utilizes different tools and libraries to extract meaningful insights.

- part a (EDA with D3.js Visualizations)
- part b (Auto EDA with Sweetviz)
- part c (Apache Beam Features)

## Part A - EDA with D3.js Visualizations

This part demonstrates the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python and includes advanced D3.js visualizations to provide an interactive and insightful view of the data.

## Part B - Auto EDA with Sweetviz

This part demonstrates the use of Sweetviz, an automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tool, to analyze a dataset. Sweetviz generates a comprehensive report that provides a detailed analysis of the dataset, including statistics, visualizations, and insights.

## Part C - Apache Beam Features

This task demonstrates the use of Apache Beam, an advanced data processing framework, to perform data analysis on a dataset. The task covers various Apache Beam features including composite transforms, pipeline IO, triggers, windowing, and ParDo.


## Conclusion

These tasks provided a comprehensive example of various data analysis and visualization techniques, showcasing the use of different tools and libraries to extract meaningful insights from datasets.
