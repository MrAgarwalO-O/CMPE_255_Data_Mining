This assignment is about learning the three data mining methodologies - 
- CRISP-DM
- SEMMA
- KDD <br>

**CRISP-DM -** The Cross-industry standard process for data mining, known as CRISP-DM, is an open standard process model that describes common approaches used by data mining experts.<br>

**SEMMA -** The SAS Institute developed SEMMA as the process of data mining. It has five steps (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess), earning the acronym of SEMMA.<br>

**KDD -** KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) is a process that involves the extraction of useful, previously unknown, and potentially valuable information from large datasets. The KDD process is an iterative process and it requires multiple iterations of the above steps to extract accurate knowledge from the data.<br>
 
 In this assignment the objective is to demonstrate a project which uses all stages for each CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD methodology.<br>
